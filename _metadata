  "description" : "Action bar, inventory monster health bar, breath, crafting tables and something else I forget affected. No more rarity overlays.\nItem pick up pop ups also transparent and quicker.\n\nChanges size of item description in crafting window, so many mods with custom crafting interface will look very wierd until I make separate patch for them, if I decide.\n\nStorage interface is an (semi)finished reskin of Enchanced Storage mod from neo.\nRequires both original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731220462]Enhanced Storage[/url] & [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1650463229]my patch[/url].\n\nQuickbar Mini supported too.",
